CSS - Cascading Style Sheets (change the appearance of HTML elements)
CSS Selector = which elements we are targeting.

px = pixels
in rgb,
r = red
g = green
b = blue


General Technique:
1. Create button with HTML
2. Style with CSS one-by-one 

space (around an element)
= margin

Hover = this :hover is a pseudo class.
active = this pseudo class activates when we click an element

Opacity = it tells how seethrough an HTML element is.
          it takes a value between zero and one.


CSS Box Model:
    > how much space an element takes up
    > how far it is away from other elements.

Class name selector > Elment name selector
fr = free space
